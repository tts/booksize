# booksize

Average size (in pages) of fiction in Finnish published between 2000 and 2022. Data by [Finna API](https://www.kiwi.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=53839221).

Note that the query returns also children's fiction, which probably affects the mean. Might well be a user error, but I couldn't find a way to filter with the class 1.4 of the [Helsinki City Library Classification System](https://finto.fi/hklj/en/page/f1.4) which AFAIK covers only fiction for adults, meaning excluding literature written to children and youth specifically. That said, the distinction is of course blurry.
